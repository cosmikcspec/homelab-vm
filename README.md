Title: Setting Up a LAN on a Host-Only Network in Oracle VM VirtualBox

Description:
This repository provides a step-by-step guide to configuring a Local Area Network (LAN) using a Host-Only Network Adapter in Oracle VM VirtualBox. The setup enables virtual machines to communicate with each other in an isolated environment without internet access, making it ideal for penetration testing, cybersecurity labs, network simulations, and private testing environments.

VM 1 will be Kali Linux as the attacker.
VM 2 will be Metasploitable 2 as the victim. 

Features:

Configure a Host-Only Network Adapter for seamless VM communication

Set static or DHCP-assigned IP addresses for VMs

Enable SSH, file sharing, and remote access between virtual machines

Simulate network attacks and defense strategies in an isolated environment

Troubleshoot common issues and optimize network settings

ðŸ”§ Requirements: Oracle VM VirtualBox, multiple VMs (Linux/Windows), and basic networking knowledge.

ðŸ“œ Usage: Follow the documentation to set up a secure and functional LAN for testing and development purposes.
